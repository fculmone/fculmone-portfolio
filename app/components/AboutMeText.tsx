      </h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a third-year Computer Science student at the University of
        Waterloo, who is deeply engaged in the expansive fields of web design
        and programming. My journey in tech has been marked by a passion for
        creating intuitive and impactful digital experiences, something I strive
        to perfect with every line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I have honed my skills through various mentoring roles
        and practical work experiences, notably in Android development. This
        exposure has not only sharpened my technical abilities, but also
        enhanced my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and capacity for
        teamwork, qualities that I believe are crucial in the fast-evolving tech
        landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the realm of code and algorithms, I find joy in the vibrant
        worlds of video games, which not only serve as a source of relaxation
        but also inspire my creativity and strategic thinking. My three
        dachshunds also play a big part in my life, bringing fun and love into
        my daily routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase a blend of my technical
        projects and the personal insights I&apos;ve gained along my academic
        and professional journey. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to
        connecting and sharing my passion for technology with you.
